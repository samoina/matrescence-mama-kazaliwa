        <p>Being a (Kenyan) mom is hard and at Mama Kazaliwa we acknowledge that. While motherhood is natural, it
          changes every part of a woman's being - and it often feels unrelenting.
          <!-- On the hard days, dear mama, remember
          it is not your fault. You are deserving of the care and attention you freely give others.  -->
          Mama Kazaliwa is a
          community that supports mothers with resources to help them become more conscious of their motherhood journey.

      <h2>No Mama is Left Behind</h2>
      <p>There is a word for the changes that one goes through in transitioning to motherhood. That word is
        <em>matrescence</em>. When a baby is born, so is a mother. Come along with us, let us share in this beautiful
        journey together.</p>

        <h2>Journey to Matrescence...</h2>
        <p>I remember vividly when I discovered I was pregnant in 2016. I had mixed feelings of extremely scared but yes very excited about what the new chapter in my life would hold. I was always looking forward to the day I would become a mother. I still remember vividly the day my daughter came, I was so scared of how my body would handle the pain and soon after that my reality came in. I was struggling and all these big feelings started trickling in. <br> Shame, guilt, doubt and I felt like I could not find a way to express what it was I was feeling. It was beautiful, don't get me wrong to watch the creation that was once in my body in my arms but there was something missing and I did not know what it was yet. When I found out about matrescence, It was like the <em>aha!</em> moment where everything began to make sense, I could finally begin to understand what a mother goes through and that a mother is born and experiences similar changes just like the baby. I wasn't crazy after all and this led me to a series of reaching out to other moms and sharing my own naked truths. <br><br>
